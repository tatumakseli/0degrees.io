        Kukaperii.fi is a consumer facing web application that fully automates the estate planning process for individuals.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The user-friendly interface first gives the user a clear outlook into their current distribution of inheritance without 
        a will. After this, by utilising legal automation, the service translates users wishes concerning their estate to a 
        legally valid will. The application contains a modern legal rules engine which guides the user to select best 
        possible options for their will by using easy to understand personalised examples.
